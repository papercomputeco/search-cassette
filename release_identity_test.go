// TestReleaseIdentityIsStamped proves that `-ldflags -X` actually reaches
// release.Version, which is the one thing the stamping scheme cannot take on
// faith: -X writes to package-level variables only, and silently does nothing
// when its target is a constant, is renamed, or moves package. Any of those
// refactors would keep compiling, keep passing every other test, and ship
// images that report the placeholder version forever — the failure this
// scheme exists to prevent, reintroduced by the mechanism meant to fix it.
//
// The release runs this with the same flag it builds the binary with (see
// .dagger/main.go) and refuses to publish when it fails. An ordinary `go
// test ./...` skips it: without the flag there is no stamp to check.
//
// It is a plain test rather than a Ginkgo spec so the pipeline can select it
// by name with -run; the Ginkgo suite entry point does not match that filter.
